# Quantum Diffusion Control

Matlab and Python implementations for quantum diffusion control (QDC) for the paper [Stochastic optimal control of open quantum systems. A. Villanueva and H. Kappen (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18635).

WORK IN PROGRESS.

In the base folder there are two implementations of QDC for one qubit and NMR multi-qubit systems.
For the NMR there are examples for 2, 4, and 7 qubits.
Just set
```
n = 2, 4, 7
```
