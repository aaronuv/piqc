# Path integral Quantum Control

Matlab implementations for the Path integral Quantum Control (PiQC) algorithm supporting the paper [Stochastic optimal control of open quantum systems. A. Villanueva and H. Kappen (2025)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2410.18635).

In the base folder there are two implementations of PiQC for one qubit and NMR multi-qubit systems.
For the NMR there are examples for 2, 4, and 7 qubits.
In the same folder there is also an implementation of the annealing variant of PiQC for the single qubit, which computes controls for closed systems.
